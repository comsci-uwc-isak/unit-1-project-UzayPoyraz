Planning
---------
We will create a program for a car company that is trying to log their car orders into a system. The program will run in terminal since the company does not want to download additional program to their pcs, it should have a simple and transparent installation, it should be very user friendly; so the users will add cars, record trips, have the trip history, edit and delete any car without a burden. The commands should be easy so the user can enter the trip distance (in kilometers). In addition, the company requests to have permanent system and backup to minimise the risk of failure. Also, the program will show the total statistics so it is more manageable.
