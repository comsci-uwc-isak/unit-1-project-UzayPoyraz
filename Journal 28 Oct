Q1. What skills have you developed so far?
I learned basic programing especially based on Bash. In addition, I learned how
programing works in business and terms that are commonly used.
Q2. What have worked for you in the classroom of CS?
The warm-ups we do in class are very beneficial because we get the chance of being tutored by a teacher.
Homeworks that are given also helps with learning and practicing the topic we are on.
Q3. What are some things/activities strategies that you would change in the CS classroom to achieve your best in the next 6 weeks.
I beleive I need more practice. Maybe creating groupchat where students can ask their questions easily may help us all.
